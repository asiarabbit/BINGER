# BINGER
* This is a C++ project dedicated for data analysis of high-energy nuclear experiments in External Target Facility, HIRFL-CSR, IMP, Lanzhou. The code itself is a framework, which contains a network of classes implementing detectors in comprehensive structural levels and functioning levels, among which some funcitonal and singleton classes are also developed in coordination with the detector entity classes. The code project is initiated and maintained during the author's PhD study sessions, mainly for accomplishment of the doctoral dissertation(due 2019).

* This code project depend on libraries of ROOT project. The anaroot project of SUMARAI, BigRIPS, RIKEN is referenced for enlightenments.

## About Installation
* The code relies on channel Id configuration files and magnetic map to function, which is not included in the code itself due to its size. Consult the author for the configuration files via asia.rabbit@163.com. Those files would be integrated in the project in future development of the code.
