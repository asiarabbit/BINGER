This is a C++ project dedicated for data analysis of high-energy nuclear experiments in External Target Facility, HIRFL-CSR, IMP, Lanzhou. The code itself is a framework, which contains a network of classes implementing detector in comprehensive structural levels and functioning levels, amony which some funcitonal and singleton classes are also developed in coordination with the detector entity classes. The code project is initiated and maintained during the author's PhD study sessions, mainly for accoplishment of doctoral dissertation(due 2019).

This code project depend on libraries of ROOT project, and anaroot project of SUMARAI, BigRIPS, RIKEN is also referenced for enlightenments.
