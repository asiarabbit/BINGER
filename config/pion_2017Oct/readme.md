This directory is for holding configuration files for the data analysis to run, which includes:

1. Detector calibration parameters
1. Detector layout parameters
1. Detecting units and channel id map table
1. Space - Time Relation (STR)

The channel Id map would be classied in a hierarchical directory system, classified in the way that the detector units are arranged physically. Config files are grouped by different experiments. A text file named "content" would be generated in the root directory of an experiment config file hierarchy to specify the content of the directory. 2017/12/25.
